# Python Programming Exercises

[![main](https://github.com/kokimoribe/python_exercises/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kokimoribe/python_exercises/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A collection of Python programming exercises designed to help learners practice coding fundamentals. Each exercise includes:
- A clear problem description
- Function template to implement
- Test cases to verify the solution

## How It Works

1. Exercise source code is maintained in the `src` directory as Python files
2. Each exercise is self-contained with its own test cases
3. GitHub Actions automatically converts these exercises into Jupyter notebooks
4. Generated notebooks are published to the `publish` branch
5. Notebooks are accessible via Google Colab for an interactive learning experience

## Getting Started

Visit any notebook through Google Colab, e.g.:
- [2025-01-12 Exercises](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kokimoribe/python_exercises/blob/publish/notebooks/2025_01_12.ipynb)

## Development

- Exercise source files are in `src/*.py`
- `notebook_generator.py` converts source files to notebooks
- GitHub Actions automatically generates and publishes notebooks
- Generated notebooks are maintained in the `publish` branch
